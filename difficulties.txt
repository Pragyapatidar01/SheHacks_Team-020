1. Not able to retrieve the dat from client to the server
sol-> We were using get request --- big big misconception POST needs to be used as we wanted the req body using the package body parser

2.The pdf was not generated initally as we were facing the bad server error  (400)

3.Nodemailer was used which makes the google account less secure and then only sends the mail, For this we added the cloud configuration feature of configuratio keys

4.CORS error- fixed using useCors and implementing proxy in package.json
